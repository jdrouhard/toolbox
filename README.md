### CompileTimeString

Based on a [blog post](https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/compile-time-string-concatenation/) by Andrzej Krzemienski.

### ScopeGuard

This is a fork of [Folly's](https://github.com/facebook/folly.git) [ScopeGuard](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/ScopeGuard.h) class with some minor modifications to remove dependencies on the rest of Folly and boost.
